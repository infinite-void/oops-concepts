# oops-concepts
Simple programs to understand the OOP paradigm



The files in the repostories are individual cpp programs(though some 2-3 files are the same program written in different files)
These were written to try out the OOPS-concepts.

Feel free to edit the files or add your files if you think they are better or convey a new concept or give a better perspective to a concept related to Object Oriented Programming.
